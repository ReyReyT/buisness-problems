                <h2>Whats the purpose of IT in modern business?</h2>
                <text>Not many people know this but the World Wide Web went live on 6th August 1991. Before this day buisnesses were content with their current technology and methods. Innovation was not necessarily important then as long as you had a strong buisness model. Buisnesses would still be using typewriters before computers and the internet picked up at a fast pace, however before people knew it most buisnesses were using new Information Technology. I.T. helps drive innovation in buisness, as there is essentially unlimeted possibilities. Innovation in I.T. results in smarter applications, faster processing and along with many other benefits it allows companies to keep an eye on their competitors. Ultimately I.T. helps to speed up the time it takes for consumers to receive goods, information and companies to create the products. I.T. has also enabled instant customer support via chat boxs on websites, only a few years back users would have to send an email and wait an unspecified amount of time for a reply, where as now most websites now have the instant chat function in order to find support. </text>
