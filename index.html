                <h2>Whats the purpose of IT in modern business?</h2>
                <text>Not many people know this but the World Wide Web went live on 6th August 1991. Before this day buisnesses were content with their current technology and methods. Innovation was not necessarily important then as long as you had a strong buisness model. Buisnesses would still be using typewriters before computers and the internet picked up at a fast pace, however before people knew it most buisnesses were using new Information Technology. I.T. helps drive innovation in buisness, as there is essentially unlimeted possibilities. Innovation in I.T. results in smarter applications, faster processing and along with many other benefits it allows companies to keep an eye on their competitors. Ultimately I.T. helps to speed up the time it takes for consumers to receive goods, information and companies to create the products. I.T. has also enabled instant customer support via chat boxs on websites, only a few years back users would have to send an email and wait an unspecified amount of time for a reply, where as now most websites have the instant chat function in order to find support. You could spend a very long time looking at all the benefits of I.T. in business. The overall purpose of I.T. in business is to make communication and process' quicker for everyone from a small shop to a giant corperation.</text>

        <h2>What causes digital projects to fail?</h2>
        <text>In 90’s mobile networks were just being established, but due to the amount of people wanting this new technology mobile network companies found that the rate at which the demand was rising was insatiable. Luckily due to the mass appeal of the new mobile products, they practically sold them self. Mobile software and mobile data was a massive market and arguably still is today. Mobile was so appealing as it let users communicate with each other from practically anywhere. 

                In more recent years businesses have tried to replicate the mass appeal of the mobile market. By almost taking a ‘build it and they will come’ approach. This way of doing things is not great and is also VERY unreliable.
                
                It is always more ideal if businesses communicate with their chosen market and understand the wants and needs of that market.</text>

        <h2>How does GDPR impact digital projects</h2>
        <text>Companies have had to follow a new set of rules in the past year due to General Data Protection Regulation being introduced. GDPR was introduced to give users more control over their online data, this applies to all states in the European Union. GDPR has a set of basic rights that all businesses have agree to stick by.</text>
        <h4>These Rights Are:</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>The right to access</li>
           <li>The right to be forgotten</li>
           <li>The right to data portability</li>
           <li>The right to be informed</li>
           <li>The right to information corrected</li>
           <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
           <li>The right to object</li>
           <li>The right to be notifed</li>
       </ul>
       <text>The GDPR rules and regulations allows users to know where their information is being sent to and how it is being used. GDPR applies to all businesses in the EU regardless of where the data processing takes place. If a business or organisation wishes to sell products or goods in the UK they will have to refer and use GDPR regulations. Any business that is complying with GDPR regulations  should have access to a data protection officer. It is now harder for businesses to obtain data and consent, as a consumer may consent to the release of their data, but due to GDPR they have the right to change their mind at any time. Businesses now have to prove that consent was given, in case a consumer wishes to back out, this proof must have a correct time and date stamp. Overall GDPR has helped users understand data laws and businesses now have adjust their data regulations and forms.</text>

        <h2>How would you go about testing digital solutions?</h2>
        <text>Businesses use a lot of different testing techniques when testing digital functionalities. Testing can be a very long process due to the amount that needs to be tested and the scope of the project. </text>
        <ul>
            <li>After a product has been developed whether it be a website or an app the testing team will initially test functionality. During this process the testing till will work closely with the developers in order to make the app look nicer and flow better, this can be a tricky process as the testing team may have suggests that are too difficult to be done in the specified time.</li>
            <li>Once the initial functionality testing is complete, the testing team will move on to integrity testing. This type of testing is done to ensure that apps will continue to run when it is backgrounded and along with websites they are tested to make sure they will work with other types of software if it needed to do so. Integrity testing will also test whether the app or website will run properly, for instance users are able to log in and out as well as changes pages or tabs when using the software.</li>
            <li>After all the initial in house testing has been done, the application will almost be ready for release. Businesses may ask fans of their brand or if their business is not well known yet they would post online and ask people to use the software and if they have issues submit them to the business. The business will then look at all the feedback and work on making changes.
                <br>
                <li>Users may be asked to test in different ways including:
                    <br>
                        - Usability: They will usually be set tasks for this and will be watched over by a member of the business.
                        <br>
                        - Eye tracking: This form of user testing shows the business exactly what the user is looking at and their tendencies. This helps companies understand where users are getting stuck and common behaviour patterns.
                        <br>
                        - Hallway testing: This is where users will be able to test the products remotely. This allows businesses to make sure the servers work and users are able to connect outside of their offices, as well as the users being able to let others test the product out side of the business environment
                        <br>
                        - Remote Testing: This allows for deeper server testing as users will be placed in remote locations and asked to test the software, in order to see users experience.
                        <br>
                        - Design optimisation: As the user is testing the software they will use eye trackers and record where the user is clicking on software in order to optimise the user experience.   </li>
            </li>
            <li>Finally businesses will often have a final specialised test where the team will be focusing on user experience rather than functionality. They will use all the feedback they have received from users and from their own tests, in order to make their product squeaky clean. 
                </li>

        <h2>How do copyright and other constraints affect websites?
        </h2>
        <text>Copyright refers to legal protection of original work of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artists, musical, and other types of creative expression. It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright.

                Copyright and other intellectual laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. For example you may not be able to use specific music due to not getting the permission to use it on your website.

        <h2>How can we overcome issues people with disabilities may face when using webpages?
        </h2>
        <text>The key to a full understanding of web accessibility is an understanding of diffrent types of disability or impairment and how those who live with impairments cope with using the internet.

                Use Alt Tags
                When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is.
                
                Create Subtitles and Transcripts
                If your web content regularly includes videos, try to provide subtitles — especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content. Popular video hosting sites such as YouTube have tools that allow users to add subtitles to their clips. Making a transcription of the video available online is also an incredibly helpful resource for users.
                
                Utilise Colour Control
                Practicing smart colour choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colours, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colourblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.
                
                Get Clickable
                For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range. It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area
                
                Include an Accessibility Guide
                If you've done your best to make your site disability-friendly, include a section that lays out all of the ways your site is accessible. Alternatively, you can post a guide on tips and tricks users can implement on their own computers. A great example of this comes from the BBC, which has an entire section devoted to accessibility.</text>
